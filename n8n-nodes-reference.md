## Node Selection Guidelines for AI Agents

When designing workflows, consider:

1. **Start with Triggers**: Choose appropriate trigger nodes based on how the workflow should be initiated
2. **Data Flow**: Use transformation nodes to shape data between services
3. **Error Handling**: Implement conditional logic and error handling with IF and Stop nodes
4. **Testing**: Use Manual Trigger and Sticky Notes for development and documentation
5. **Community Nodes**: Leverage specialized community nodes (like those listed above) for specific service integrations
6. **Performance**: Consider using Wait nodes for rate limiting and Limit nodes for data volume control
